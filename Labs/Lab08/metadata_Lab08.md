## Logistic growth model user-defined function

This script creates a user-defined function in R to model the logistic growth of a population, and produce a plot (Abundance over Time) and associated .csv file with the generation and population abundance data.

The function takes four arguments: the intrinsic growth rate of the population (r), the population carrying capacity (K), the total number of generations for which the model will run through (totalGen), and the initial size of the population (init_pop).
